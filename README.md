# gc-cykp - Grammar Converter and CYK Parser
## Description
The program works with context-free grammars and has 2 modes:
 - Grammar convertation. Takes a context-free grammar in any form and converts it into the Chomsky form.
 - Text recognition. Takes a context-free grammar and a text, converts the grammar to Chomsky form and executes Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm.
